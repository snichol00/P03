<h3> Overview </h3>
<p> Scala stands for "scaleable language," meaning that it can be scaled up or down to meet the user's needs,
  using a combination of object-oriented and functional programmins. Object-oriented programming will be familiar to java users, and includes the four key tenets of polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.
  In many ways, Scala is a more concise and intuitive version of Java, but its functional programming aspect provides more substantive differences.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Object-oriented: Modularity makes it easier to troubleshoot</li>
  <li>Statically typed: Catches errors at compile time, before execution</li>
  <li>Lazy computation: Only computes what is necessary, which makes it run faster</li>
  <li>Type safe: doesnâ€™t allow the use of incompatible data types</li>
</ul>
