    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p> Scala stands for "scalable language," meaning that it can be scaled up or down to meet the user's needs,
      using a combination of object-oriented and functional programming. Object-oriented programming will be familiar to java users, and includes the four key tenets of polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.
      In many ways, Scala is a more concise and intuitive version of Java, but its use of functional programming (which will be review below) makes it a substantially different language.
    </p>

    <h3>Improvements on Java</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scalable: Better support for backend operations</li>
      <li>Concise: Java tends to be repetitive and demands that the user manually write a lot of functions that are basic and widely used, while scala is a smarter and less verbose language</li>
      <li>Readability: Without extra clutter, code tends to be more easily digestible and the functions seem more intuitive, allowing easier debugging</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Object-oriented: Modularity makes it easier to troubleshoot</li>
      <li>Statically typed: Catches errors at compile time, before execution</li>
      <li>Lazy computation: Only computes what is necessary, which makes it run faster</li>
      <li>Type safe: doesnâ€™t allow the use of incompatible data types</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Functional Programming</h3>
    <h6>Functional programming is a way of computing that focuses less on defining a function step-by-step and more on the outcome, creating more concise but less explicit code. It relies on the machine to fill in the steps in between.</h6>
    <h5> Key Features </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Declarative rather than imperative: meaning it's more focused on the what is accomplished than how it's done</li>
      <li>Pure functions: Always the same output for every input</li>
      <li>Avoids shared state: Shared state is any variables or objects that exist in the same scope.
        Shared state can lead to very common bugs such as the race condition, a bug that happens when two
        concurrent functions which mutate the same variable or object cause undesirable effects.</li>
      <li>Immutability: Prevents lossy data flow and the bugs that are associated with mutable data.</li>
    </ul>
